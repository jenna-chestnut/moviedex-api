## Setting up a server created to handle large sets of data

### This code ensures our client will only receive the data they have searched for, & will not have to load the initial data and filter client-side, which would make the app run slower and have longer download times.

_Dotenv_ is utilized in this code and will need to be set up for code to run successfully.
